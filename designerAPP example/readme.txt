
notes:
I am unsure of whether this code requires postgres, and pgadmin on your computer
the designer application can be accessed by typing 'designer' into your development environment's terminal
the datetime input on the application currently only works from 11/1/2013 to 12/31/2013 for some reason
most of the doors opening and closing are D003
11-26-2013 and 12-30-2013 will give you separate list outputs if you would like to test.
datetime_list.ui was generated by the designer APP I did not have to manually create or modify it. if anyone was wondering

repositories:
pip install PyQt5
pip install psycopg2

pip install pyqt5-tools # to access the designer APP
